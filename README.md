# Astro Rate
Astro Rate is an innovative app that leverages the power of OpenAI and Pinecone to provide accurate answers to professor lookups. With Astro Rate, you can easily find information about professors and their ratings. 

## Features

- Professor Lookups: Simply enter the name of a professor, and Astro Rate will use the RAG (Retrieve, Answer, Generate) model from OpenAI to provide you with relevant information.

- RateMyProfessor Integration: Astro Rate also allows you to provide a RateMyProfessor link for a professor. The app will scrape the necessary information from the link and add it to the Pinecone database, ensuring up-to-date and comprehensive data.
